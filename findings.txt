	Searching the area of Oklahoma reveals that the number of years used in calculations is a large factor in deciding the probability of the next earthquake.
When using data from 100 years back, the median time until the next earthquake was 0.007 years (roughly 2.5 days), but when using data from only the past 3 years,
when quakes in Oklahoma suddenly skyrocketed, the median time until the next earthquake dropped to 0.0002 years (roughly 2 hours). Furthermore, the probability of 
an earthquake occurring within the next day jumped from 23.7% to 99.96%. This is likely explained by the spike in earthquakes inside of Oklahoma in recent years 
caused by increased hydraulic fracturing efforts. To accurately calculate the chance of an earthquake occurring, the data must go back far enough to gather significant 
amounts of data, but if too much data is used, current trends might become diluted, and the predictions may actually become less accurate.
